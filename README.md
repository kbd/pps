# pps

This is just a color-scheme for the [pp Go pretty-print library](https://github.com/k0kubun/pp/).
"pps" &rarr; "pp scheme".

Becuase this is Go, the easiest way to use this configuration is just to import it:

```go

import (
	"github.com/k0kubun/pp/v3"
	"github.com/kbd/pps"
)

...

pp.SetColorScheme(pps.Scheme)
```
